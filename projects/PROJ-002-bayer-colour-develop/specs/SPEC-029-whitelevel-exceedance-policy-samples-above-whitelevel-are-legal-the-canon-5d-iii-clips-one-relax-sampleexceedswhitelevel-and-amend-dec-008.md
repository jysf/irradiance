# SPEC-029: WhiteLevel-exceedance policy: samples above `WhiteLevel` are legal (the Canon 5D-III clips one); relax `SampleExceedsWhiteLevel` and amend DEC-008

> **OUTLINE — `cycle: frame`.** This spec exists so its ID is stable and
> siblings can declare `depends_on: [SPEC-029]`. Capture **scope** (Context /
> Goal / Non-Goals) and **dependencies** only — the *approach* is designed
> just-in-time when this moves to `design`. Do not pre-design it here.

## Context

`plane::unpack_into` asserts every sample is `≤ WhiteLevel` and errors
`SampleExceedsWhiteLevel` otherwise — DEC-008's "max > WhiteLevel is impossible,
the free assertion" (`src/plane.rs:321`), true for the mono corpus. The Canon
5D-III Bayer DNG carries a sample `15464` above its `WhiteLevel 15000`, which is
**legal** — real sensors record specular highlights above the nominal white — so
the assertion rejects a valid file. This spec amends DEC-008 and relaxes the policy
so an above-WhiteLevel sample no longer fails unpack. Prerequisite for the bit-exact
oracle (SPEC-025); the plane must preserve the raw values (clamping is develop's
job, not unpack's) or the `dnglab --raw-checksum` can't match.

## Goal

Amend DEC-008 and relax `plane::unpack_into` so a sample above `WhiteLevel` no
longer errors — the Canon 5D-III plane unpacks, with raw sample values **preserved,
not clamped**. Keep a meaningful bound (samples still fit the declared bit depth).
A new DEC records the amendment (reconcile its number — DEC-029 is informally
reserved for the crustyimg LUT boundary).

## Inputs

What the implementer will read or consume.

- **Files to read:** `path/to/file.ext` — why
- **External APIs:** <name, docs link, auth requirements>
- **Related code paths:** `src/some/module/`

## Outputs

What the implementer will produce.

- **Files created:** `path/to/new.ext` — purpose
- **Files modified:** `path/to/existing.ext` — what changes
- **New endpoints / functions / components:** <names and signatures>
- **New flags / options:** each flag's accepted values **and its default** — an
  unstated default makes the implementer guess.
- **Database changes:** <migrations, if any>

## Acceptance Criteria

Testable outcomes. Each must map to at least one test. Cover happy
path, error cases, edge cases.

- [ ] Criterion 1 (testable)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (testable)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (testable)

## Failing Tests

Written during the **design** cycle, BEFORE handoff. The implementer's
job in **build** is to make these pass.

- **`path/to/test.file`**
  - `"test description 1"` — asserts: ...
  - `"test description 2"` — asserts: ...

## Non-Goals

- Clamping / normalizing samples to WhiteLevel — that is develop (STAGE-007+) and
  would break the bit-exact plane
- Multi-strip assembly — SPEC-028
- The bit-exact oracle — SPEC-025
- Removing the layer0 packed-bits check (`width*height*bits == strip bits`)

## Notes for the Implementer

Gotchas, style preferences, reuse opportunities. Keep short — the full
context graph lives in the handoff file.

## Reflection

*Appended during **ship**. Three questions, short answers.*

1. **What would I do differently next time?**
   — <answer>

2. **Does any template, constraint, or decision need updating?**
   — <answer — if yes but not done this session, record it in
   `/guidance/signals.yaml`: `type: lesson` (with its N-count) for a recurring
   coding pattern, `type: process-debt` for tooling/process friction. A close
   then forces the decision. See `docs/signals.md`.>

3. **Is there a follow-up spec I should write now before I forget?**
   — <answer>

4. **Where was the worst defect caught?** — one word from a fixed vocabulary so
   the defect-escape distribution is greppable across specs:
   `design` | `build` | `verify` | `ship` | `escaped` (reached prod/runtime) |
   `none` (clean first try).
   — <one word>
   *(Runtime/operational defects — the escape-prone class — only exist once the
   artifact meets its real host. `escaped` here is a signal to strengthen the
   §12 behavioral pre-flight for that surface.)*

5. **What can a user do now that they couldn't before?** — one sentence,
   before → after; quote the confirming number if one exists, name the outcome
   if not. Write `none` if this spec has no user-visible outcome — that is a
   real, greppable result, not a blank. This is the line a downstream work-log's
   `impact` field is transcribed from, and both halves are already written above
   (## Context is the before, ## Goal is the after): confirm the prediction,
   don't reconstruct it from memory.
   — <answer | none>
