# SPEC-002: Corpus manifest reader and skip-when-absent harness

> **OUTLINE — `cycle: frame`.** This spec exists so its ID is stable and
> siblings can declare `depends_on: [SPEC-002]`. Capture **scope** (Context /
> Goal / Non-Goals) and **dependencies** only — the *approach* is designed
> just-in-time when this moves to `design`. Do not pre-design it here.

## Context

DEC-003 settled corpus storage and `tests/corpus/manifest.toml` already ships
seeded with three pinned Q2 Monochrom frames — path, size, sha256, licence,
source, and the pinned `dnglab --raw-checksum`. **Nothing reads it.** Its own
header records that as a scheduled debt owned by this spec.

## Goal

The reader. Resolve `$IRRADIANCE_CORPUS_DIR` (defaulting to the gitignored
`tests/corpus/tier-b/`), verify each entry's `sha256`, and **skip loudly —
naming the missing file** — when a tier-B entry is absent.

A silent skip reports green for work it never did, which is the same defect
class as an oracle that cannot go red. Nothing else in this stage may hardcode
a corpus path.

## Inputs

What the implementer will read or consume.

- **Files to read:** `path/to/file.ext` — why
- **External APIs:** <name, docs link, auth requirements>
- **Related code paths:** `src/some/module/`

## Outputs

What the implementer will produce.

- **Files created:** `path/to/new.ext` — purpose
- **Files modified:** `path/to/existing.ext` — what changes
- **New endpoints / functions / components:** <names and signatures>
- **New flags / options:** each flag's accepted values **and its default** — an
  unstated default makes the implementer guess.
- **Database changes:** <migrations, if any>

## Acceptance Criteria

Testable outcomes. Each must map to at least one test. Cover happy
path, error cases, edge cases.

- [ ] Criterion 1 (testable)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (testable)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (testable)

## Failing Tests

Written during the **design** cycle, BEFORE handoff. The implementer's
job in **build** is to make these pass.

- **`path/to/test.file`**
  - `"test description 1"` — asserts: ...
  - `"test description 2"` — asserts: ...

## Non-Goals

Explicit scope limits. If the implementer thinks any of these need to
happen, they should create a new spec (in this stage's backlog), not
expand this one.

- ...

## Notes for the Implementer

⚠ **This spec creates the crate's first module, and carries an obligation SPEC-001
could not close.** Verified at SPEC-001 ship: a single
`#[allow(clippy::panic, clippy::expect_used)]` on a `pub fn` passes **all seven
gates** while shipping two panics on the public API — **no module required, live
today**. DEC-009's red-proof pins the policy at the crate *root*, and no
`#![deny]` mutation test can observe an `#[allow]` below it.

Close it here, in whichever form fits the module layout you create. The likely
answer is a gate on `allow(` outside `#[cfg(test)]` and `src/bin/`. ⚠ If you take
that route, heed the `attribute-text-inside-doc-comments` lesson signal (**N=5**):
anchor at column 0, exclude `//`, `//!` and `/* */`, and assert the match count
rather than taking the first hit. Every one of those five instances produced a
wrong *answer* rather than an error.

Also soften `guidance/constraints.yaml:33` in the same change — it currently
reads as a stronger guarantee than holds until this lands.


Gotchas, style preferences, reuse opportunities. Keep short — the full
context graph lives in the handoff file.

## Reflection

*Appended during **ship**. Three questions, short answers.*

1. **What would I do differently next time?**
   — <answer>

2. **Does any template, constraint, or decision need updating?**
   — <answer — if yes but not done this session, record it in
   `/guidance/signals.yaml`: `type: lesson` (with its N-count) for a recurring
   coding pattern, `type: process-debt` for tooling/process friction. A close
   then forces the decision. See `docs/signals.md`.>

3. **Is there a follow-up spec I should write now before I forget?**
   — <answer>

4. **Where was the worst defect caught?** — one word from a fixed vocabulary so
   the defect-escape distribution is greppable across specs:
   `design` | `build` | `verify` | `ship` | `escaped` (reached prod/runtime) |
   `none` (clean first try).
   — <one word>
   *(Runtime/operational defects — the escape-prone class — only exist once the
   artifact meets its real host. `escaped` here is a signal to strengthen the
   §12 behavioral pre-flight for that surface.)*

5. **What can a user do now that they couldn't before?** — one sentence,
   before → after; quote the confirming number if one exists, name the outcome
   if not. Write `none` if this spec has no user-visible outcome — that is a
   real, greppable result, not a blank. This is the line a downstream work-log's
   `impact` field is transcribed from, and both halves are already written above
   (## Context is the before, ## Goal is the after): confirm the prediction,
   don't reconstruct it from memory.
   — <answer | none>
