# irradiance — future plans

The forward direction for the RAW engine, beyond what ships in the current
wave. This is a **living, intentionally-incomplete** document: it is
reconstructed from `PROJ-001`'s brief roadmap and stage structure, and the
maintainer has further targets that still need to be recovered from past
planning sessions and folded in here (see [Open questions](#open-questions--to-revisit)).

> **Scope of this doc.** This is the *app's* forward plan. It is not the
> spec-driven template's own roadmap — that lives in
> [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) and governs the workflow, not irradiance.
> The authoritative, machine-readable plan is the `roadmap:` block and
> "Enables" section of the active project brief
> ([`projects/PROJ-001-monochrome-dng-develop/brief.md`](../projects/PROJ-001-monochrome-dng-develop/brief.md));
> this doc is the readable narrative over it.

## The through-line

There is no permissively-licensed, maintained, pure-Rust RAW decoder. Every
mature one (dcraw / LibRaw / rawspeed and their descendants) carries GPL, LGPL
or AGPL, and there is no permissive option in Go, Java, Scala or Elixir either.
irradiance exists to be that missing primitive: a **clean-room, patent-safe,
pure-Rust RAW → image** engine the ecosystem can actually adopt. Its first
consumer is **crustyimg** (whose "RAW" support today is really the camera's
embedded JPEG); the maintainer's own driver is developing Leica Q2 Monochrom
files reproducibly into web assets.

Every wave is held to the same bar: **independent-oracle-verified correctness,
no panics on hostile input, deterministic output, and a provenance-ledger entry
for every algorithm and decoder** naming its source and that source's licence.

## Where we are now

`PROJ-001 — Monochrome DNG develop` is the active wave. The pixel pipeline
(container → plane → develop → tone) is shipped; the project is not yet closed.

| Stage | Status | Delivers |
|---|---|---|
| STAGE-001 Foundations | ✅ shipped | Corpus, TIFF/IFD reader, DNG tag model, metadata oracle |
| STAGE-002 Monochrome plane | ✅ shipped | 14-bit→u16 unpack, bit-exact plane oracle, levels + geometry |
| STAGE-003 Opcodes & output | ✅ shipped | `FixBadPixelsConstant`, `WarpRectilinear`, sRGB tone curve, develop oracle |
| STAGE-004 crustyimg integration | ⏳ proposed | `raw-develop` feature, `Image` adapter, metadata-truthfulness fixes |
| STAGE-005 Harden the harness | ⏳ in flight | Absent-vs-unparseable tag oracle, fuzz crate under `-D warnings`, gate-audit tests |

STAGE-005 was not in the original four-stage brief — it was added 2026-08-30
after STAGE-001 shipped having revealed a gate that had never run and an oracle
that could not tell a missing tag from an unreadable one. Finishing **004** and
**005** is what remains to close PROJ-001.

## Near-term: finish PROJ-001

- **crustyimg integration (STAGE-004).** Wire irradiance into crustyimg behind a
  `raw-develop` feature, provide the `Image` adapter, and fix the
  metadata-truthfulness gaps so `crustyimg web q2m.dng -o photo.avif` produces a
  publishable image and `info` reports real sensor data, not the embedded
  preview's.
- **Harness hardening (STAGE-005).** The open specs: lint the fuzz crate (the
  second cargo graph currently sits outside every `-D warnings` gate),
  make the gates stop reporting green on checks they never ran, and narrow the
  develop-oracle's scope around warp-bearing pixels.

## PROJ-002 — Bayer develop (colour) · *next, largest wave*

The colour pipeline that PROJ-001 deliberately omits (a Monochrom sensor has no
colour filter array, so there is nothing to demosaic). Planned content:

- A **CFA model** (Bayer mosaic description and indexing).
- A **clean-room Malvar–He–Cutler demosaic** — implemented from the published
  algorithm, not ported from any copyleft decoder.
- **Colour matrices** — camera-native to a working/display colour space.
- A **ColorChecker ΔE oracle** — the first *fully independent* correctness
  check. PROJ-001's oracle is single-sourced (both the plane checksum and the
  reference render come from rawler via dnglab), so a tolerance test could pass
  while both are wrong together; a ΔE measurement against a physical
  ColorChecker target breaks that dependency.

Rough size signal from the brief: the Bayer path is ~1,300–1,600 lines vs.
~550–700 for the monochrome path. Resumes once PROJ-001 ships and a colour
camera's files are in the corpus.

## PROJ-003 — Lossless JPEG SOF-3 · *next*

The compressed-plane decoder. The Q2M is uncompressed so PROJ-001 does not need
it, but it is the **keystone shared by roughly eight vendor decoders** — most
non-trivial RAW files carry a losslessly-JPEG-compressed plane (e.g. the Leica M
Monochrom Typ 246 is big-endian *and* JPEG-compressed). Landing SOF-3 is what
turns irradiance from "develops one uncompressed file" into "develops the files
people actually have."

## Later — more sensors and vendor containers

Accepted direction, horizon "later" in the brief:

- **X-Trans** sensors, including a **DHT demosaic**.
- **Native Fuji RAF** container parsing.
- **Nikon NEF**, including its **linearization curve**.
- Further vendor containers as demand and corpus coverage justify (PROJ-001
  explicitly fences out NEF/RAF/CR2/ARW/NRW).

## Cross-cutting commitments

These hold across every wave and constrain how the above gets built:

- **Permissive, clean-room, patent-safe.** Implemented from published
  specifications (the Adobe DNG spec carries a patent grant for compliant
  implementations), never by reading copyleft source. `cargo deny` sees only
  declared licences, so the **provenance ledger** is what makes the permissive
  claim defensible.
- **Library, not application.** No I/O, no CLI, no async runtime; zero runtime
  dependencies. `irr` stays an internal dev/oracle binary.
- **Panic-free on untrusted input**, enforced mechanically (five deny-level
  lints + a red-proof), because RAW is attacker-influenced binary data.
- **Determinism.** Byte-identical output across platforms; any future
  parallelism (e.g. a `parallel` feature) must preserve it — crustyimg's
  `build --frozen` depends on it (`DEC-002`).
- **Memory budget.** A ~47 MP develop must stay within a sane budget; a future
  `f32` develop path and/or tiling redesign are anticipated pressure points
  (`DEC-018`).

## Explicitly out of scope (rejected, not deferred)

- Interactive / per-image editing — belongs in `crustyimg-lab`, not here.
- Competing with Lightroom on render quality — an unbounded tuning loop.
- A shipped CLI product surface — `irr` is dev/oracle-only.

## Open questions / to revisit

- **Recover the fuller target list from past planning sessions.** The
  maintainer has targets beyond PROJ-002/003 and the "later" formats that are
  not yet captured here; fold them in once recovered.
- **Refresh the permissive-RAW tooling survey.** The brief's landscape survey
  dates to 2026-08-15. A periodic research pass — new crates, decoders, or
  reference implementations in this space, and anything that changes the
  build-vs-adopt calculus for a given decoder — should update both this doc and
  the relevant project brief.
