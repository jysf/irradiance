# scripts/lint-red-proof.sh — proves the LIBRARY's panic-free lint policy
# actually bites (constraint `oracle-must-be-shown-red` applied to a gate rather
# than an oracle; SPEC-001 acceptance criterion 5). Mechanism per DEC-009,
# which supersedes DEC-007 (which superseded DEC-006).
#
# A lint policy that has never rejected anything is not a policy. This script is
# a MUTATION TEST of the real crate, run as a CONTROLLED experiment:
#
#   1. copy the crate (Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, src/, any toolchain pin) to a
#      temp dir
#   2. CONTROL — run the exact clippy invocation CI runs, on the UNMUTATED copy.
#      It must exit 0.
#   3. inject five violations into the COPIED src/lib.rs, immediately after the
#      last inner attribute — so src/lib.rs's own `#![deny(...)]` is the only
#      thing that can reject them
#   4. MUTATION — run the same invocation again, and once more WITHOUT CI's
#      blanket `-D warnings`
#
# The working tree is never mutated, so there is no restore path to get wrong.
#
# ── Why the control run exists (DEC-009, the whole point) ───────────────────
# Three rounds of this gate asserted things about the MUTATED run only: that
# clippy ran, that it exited non-zero, that the expected lint names were in its
# log. None of those can distinguish "failed for the reason I intended" from
# "failed for any reason at all" — and that distinction is the entire value of a
# red-proof. Measured consequence (verify round 2): one legal `//` comment in
# lib.rs's prologue moved the injection ABOVE the inner attributes, where
# `pub fn` is a syntax error; clippy exited 101, rustc RENDERED the multi-line
# `#![deny(...)]` span in the diagnostic — putting every expected lint name in
# the log — and the proof printed success with no lint having fired. Combined
# with `deny`→`allow`, that was seven green gates and a panic shipped in the
# library.
#
# The control closes that class by construction: if the unmutated copy is clean
# under the same command, then a failure of the mutated copy is attributable to
# the injection. No amount of log-grepping can do that.
#
# ── The five assertions ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0. clippy is actually available (a `cargo` that cannot run clippy exits
#      non-zero and an exit-code-only proof reports green having compiled
#      nothing — verify round 1, measured with a stub cargo).
#   1. CONTROL: unmutated copy, exact CI invocation, exit 0.
#   2. MUTATION: same invocation, exit non-zero.
#   3. All FIVE policy lints fired — matched on clippy's `index.html#<lint>`
#      help URL, which is emitted ONLY when the lint actually fires, never by a
#      rendered source span. Bare lint names are NOT sufficient: they are the
#      text of the policy itself and appear whenever rustc renders it.
#   4. The diagnostics are LOCATED inside the injected line range — the names
#      came from the injected code, not from somewhere else in the file.
#   5. SEVERITY: the mutated copy is rejected even WITHOUT `-D warnings`. That
#      is what makes the policy `deny`-level in the library rather than
#      `warn`-level promoted by a CI flag. With `#![warn(...)]` this run exits
#      0 (measured) and the proof fails, as it should — a consumer running a
#      plain `cargo clippy` would otherwise see nothing.
#
# ── Known residual limits, stated rather than papered over ──────────────────
# - The injection point is found by parsing the attribute prologue. It anchors
#   on the LAST inner attribute (not the first non-prologue line), so comments
#   of any kind in the prologue cannot move it. A prologue shape the parser does
#   not understand fails LOUDLY here rather than injecting somewhere useless.
# - Assertion 3 greps a log. It is sound only because assertion 1 (control) and
#   assertion 4 (span location) bracket it. Do not remove either and keep the
#   grep. In particular: never put a literal clippy help URL in src/lib.rs's
#   prose — a rendered span could then reintroduce the round-2 defect.
# - This proves the policy bites on lib.rs. It says nothing about future modules
#   that carry their own `#[allow(...)]`.
