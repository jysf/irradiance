# scripts/lint-fuzz-red-proof.sh — proves the FUZZ graph's clippy gate
# (`just lint-fuzz`, the CI job `rust / clippy — fuzz graph`) actually bites
# (constraint `oracle-must-be-shown-red` applied to a gate rather than an
# oracle — SPEC-003/FU-14 widened it to cover gates; SPEC-011). Mechanism per
# DEC-009 (the library's `scripts/lint-red-proof.sh`), here with ONE injected
# fault rather than five, and a fuzz-specific twist explained below.
#
# `fuzz/` is a SECOND cargo graph that DEC-011 keeps outside the library's
# `[dependencies]`, so the library's own clippy — `just lint` / `just lint-ci`
# / the `clippy` CI job, all rooted at the repo's Cargo.toml — never compiles a
# single fuzz target. DEC-027 adds the second invocation
# (`--manifest-path fuzz/Cargo.toml`), exactly as DEC-011 did for licensing.
# A gate that has never gone red cannot be told from one that never ran, so
# this script runs it as a CONTROLLED experiment on a temp-dir copy:
#
#   1. copy the two crates the fuzz graph needs (the library by path + fuzz/)
#      to a temp dir
#   2. CONTROL — run the exact clippy invocation the gate runs, on the
#      UNMUTATED copy. It must exit 0 (the fuzz crate is clippy-clean — SPEC-011
#      Notes: 0 warnings on 0.1.98 and 0.1.99, even under the five panic-free
#      lints, which is why this spec ships NO code fixes).
#   3. inject ONE default-clippy violation into a COPIED fuzz target
#   4. MUTATION — run the same invocation again, and once more WITHOUT the
#      gate's `-D warnings`
#
# The working tree is never mutated, so there is no restore path to get wrong.
#
# ── Why the control run exists (DEC-009, the whole point) ───────────────────
# A red with no control proves only "clippy failed", not "the gate rejected the
# injection". The library's proof learned this the hard way (DEC-009, round 2:
# a mis-landed injection made clippy fail with every expected lint NAME in the
# log and not one lint firing). With the unmutated copy clean under the same
# command, a red below is attributable to the injection by construction.
#
# ── Why the injected fault is a WARN-level clippy lint, and why -D warnings ──
# ── is proven load-bearing (the fuzz-specific twist) ────────────────────────
# The library crate carries a crate-root `#![deny(...)]`; its red-proof injects
# violations of THAT policy and proves it is `deny`-level even without CI's
# blanket `-D warnings`. The fuzz crate is the opposite: `fuzz/Cargo.toml` has
# NO `[lints]` table and the targets carry NO `#![deny]` — so `-D warnings` is
# the ONLY thing with teeth here. The chosen scope (DEC-027) is clippy's default
# lint set promoted to deny by that flag, NOT the five panic-free lints.
#
# So the injected fault is `clippy::unnecessary_cast` — a DEFAULT, WARN-level
# clippy lint (not a panic-free-only one; those are out of scope and the crate
# passes them anyway). That choice lets this proof assert the thing that makes
# the fuzz gate a gate:
#   * WITH `-D warnings` the injected copy is REJECTED (assertions 2–4), and
#   * WITHOUT `-D warnings` the SAME copy exits 0 (assertion 5).
# Drop `-D warnings` from the recipe or the CI job and the gate stops catching
# this entire class — assertion 5 is what pins that the flag is load-bearing,
# the fuzz analogue of the library proof's severity run (DEC-009 assertion 5),
# inverted: there the source `#![deny]` is load-bearing, here the flag is.
#
# ── The injection must be a CLIPPY lint, matched by its help URL ────────────
# Assertion 3 matches clippy's `index.html#<lint>` help-URL fragment, emitted
# ONLY when a lint FIRES — never by a rendered source span, and never for a
# rustc lint (an unused variable / import would fail this gate by exit code but
# emit no clippy help URL, so it could not be name-matched robustly). That is
# why the fault is a clippy lint (`unnecessary_cast`) and not, say, a bare
# `unused_variables`. The bare name is NOT sufficient: it can appear in a
# rendered span. Borrowed straight from `scripts/lint-red-proof.sh`.
#
# ── Clippy pinning (PATCH-004) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# This script runs BARE `cargo clippy`, exactly as `scripts/lint-red-proof.sh`
# does, and names which clippy proved the result (assertion 0). The fault is a
# long-stable default lint that fires identically on Homebrew's local clippy and
# on CI's floating `@stable`, so the proof is version-agnostic by construction —
# the pinning that matters for the *honest-tree* gate (`just lint-fuzz` carries
# the `~/.cargo/bin/cargo +stable` PATH pin like `just lint-ci`) does not matter
# for proving the gate's mechanism bites. CI runs this job under
# `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` + `components: clippy`, so there the bare
# `cargo clippy` is stable's.
