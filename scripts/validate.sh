# scripts/validate.sh — the schema gate (DEC-001 §1).
#
# Checks that every spec's front-matter carries the required STRUCTURAL fields
# with valid values, so the front-matter stays a reliable contract for reports,
# `--json`, and any downstream consumer (MCP, exporter, UI). Exits non-zero on
# any violation — the CI gate contract (DEC-001 §2, exit 1).
#
# Two scopes, on purpose:
#   * Required-KEYS check — specs + patches + spikes. Schema-specific, so it
#     stays scoped to the lanes whose schema it knows.
#   * Front-matter PARSE gate (SPEC-016) — EVERY *.md under projects/ and the
#     decisions dir (handoffs/ and patches/ live under projects/). Schema-
#     agnostic: it only asks whether a real YAML parser can read the front
#     matter at all, which generalises to every artifact this repo ships. The
#     key check never parsed, so an artifact no parser could read was reported
#     "valid" — one shipped and was archived (SPEC-016 Context). See
#     front_matter_parse_report() in _lib.sh.
# Cost recording on SHIPPED specs is a separate gate (`just cost-audit`);
# decision records are linted by `just decisions-audit`. This validator is the
# place to grow stage/brief checks over time.
